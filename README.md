# Bioinformatics

# DNA Sequence classifier
* data: human genome, chimpanzee genome, dog genome
* learned how to working with DNA Seqeunce, 3 way to encode genome sequence.
* train a machine learning model with human genome
* percision, recall, F1 socre were used as accuracy metric.

# Genomic selection with ANN AND CNN
* data: wheat genotype, and wheat yield form different field
* calculating SNP signifincant
* lasso regression used as bench model
* 3 layers neural network and 4 layer CNN.
* pearson correlation was used as accuracy.
* inspired by the paper and reference
*  "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334609713_A_Guide_for_Using_Deep_Learning_for_Complex_Trait_Genomic_Prediction"
