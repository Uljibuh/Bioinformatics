# Bioinformatics

# DNA Sequence classifier
* data: human genome, chipanzee genome, dog genome
* learn hwo to working with DNA Seqeunce, 3 way to encode genome sequence.
* train a machine learning model with human genome
* percision, recall, F1 socre were used as accuricies.

# Genomic selection with Neural Network
* data: wheat genotype, and wheat yield form different field
* calculating SNP signifincant
* lasso regression used as bench model
* 3 layers neural network was used
* pearson correlation was used as accuracy.
